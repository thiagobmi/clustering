# clustering_algorithms
These are two k-means based clustering algorithms. n is the number of two-dimensional points and k is the number of centroids.

The clustp4.c is a packet-oriented C code that receive and clusterize points in k centroids. It also creates files to store data.

The clustering_random_points.c generates and clusterize n random two-dimensional points in k centroids. A centroid starts as a random point, and it's coordinates are defined by the averages of the coordinates of the points that belong to that centroid.
